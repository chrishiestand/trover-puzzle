puzzle solver for the trover saves the universe puzzle. Only it turns out that the in-game puzzle is unsolvable. I should have listened to Trover.

This puzzle solver just shows that the in-game puzzle is unsolveable. And if the inital state of the in-game puzzle were different, it might be solvable.
